                High-quality eddy covariance data through 17 hours measured over permeable sand in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida. Water depth varied from 1 to 1.5 m, and sediment permeability was 1.3 10-11 m2. Raw data were recorded in 15 min data segments that included a short pause at the end.

                First panel: Three velocity components (x, y, z) and mean current velocity varying between 1 and 5 cm s-1. Most of the variation in velocity represents wave action. Second panel: Oxygen concentration measured with a fast-responding micro-electrode and an oxygen meter. The latter was used for calibration. Third panel: Cumulative oxygen fluxes with linear trends indicating a strong consistent flux signal in the data. Fourth panel: Oxygen fluxes, one for each 15 min data segment, and light measured over the sand. Negative fluxes represent an uptake.

                Note the clear day-night-day cycle (Fourth panel). The four last fluxes of extreme size were artificially induced by people wading upstream from the eddy covariance instrument. Night time oxygen uptake averaged -368 ± 21 mmol m-2 day-1 (SE, n = 45) which is almost 4 times larger than the flux of -98 ± 21 mmol m-2 day-1 (SE, n = 5) measured concurrently in in situ chambers. This difference was likely caused by extensive flushing of the permeable sediment by current flow, oscillating wave-generated flow, and oscillating pressure at the sediment surface. Existing chamber technology cannot fully reproduce these naturally occurring drivers of porewater exchange.
