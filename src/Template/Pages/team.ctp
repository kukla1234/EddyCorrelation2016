                    My educational background is in civil engineering. As an undergraduate I focused on mechanical design 
                    and construction while my graduate work focused, broadly speaking, on applied mathematical modeling of 
                    transport processes and mass and energy flows. I earned my PhD degree in 1988 from the Technical 
                    University of Denmark. After that I worked at the Danish National Environmental Research Institute 
                    where I was responsible for long-term modeling of nitrogen leaching from agricultural land. In 1996, 
                    I relocated to the University of Virginia (UVA) and have since then focused my research on 
                    biogeochemical cycling in aquatic benthic environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A dominant approach in my work at UVA has been the use of applied mathematical modeling, which I have 
                    combined with the development of new measuring techniques and approaches. I see these two foci as highly 
                    complementary and powerful, and on a personal level I am very excited to apply them to address research 
                    questions focusing on the benthic environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 2001 forward, I pioneered the aquatic eddy covariance technique for oxygen flux measurements in 
                    collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, Germany. At first, this was a 
                    side project to my ongoing modeling activities, but given our first successes and the potential of the 
                    approach, it quickly became the main focus of my work. Today I work exclusively on the eddy covariance 
                    technique. As reflected in the <a href="/publications"> publications from my lab group</a> this work is 
                    focusing on further developing the technique, and also on applying it to benthic environments where 
                    traditional flux approaches are hard to use, and where our knowledge on benthic exchange is thus limited.

                        My research focuses on the dynamic of major biogenic elements in coastal zones and on 
                        the interactions between macrophytes and biogeochemical cycles in these environments. 
                        During my master degree, I carried out an in situ study on biogeochemical dynamics of 
                        redox species (O2, Fe2+, HS-, Fe3+ et FeS(aq)) in permeable sediments on tidal scales 
                        using in situ voltammetry. My PhD project focused on the influence of seagrasses on the 
                        cycles of biogenic elements such as O2, C, N and P. One part of this work was about the 
                        spatio-temporal dynamic of seagrass meadow metabolism (measured by ex situ core incubations) 
                        in relation to changes in the distributions of macrophytes and macrofauna. I also studied 
                        the impact of seagrass regression on the nutrient biogeochemistry in sediments of a coastal 
                        lagoon. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During my Post Doc position, I will quantify seagrass metabolism and its dynamics on hourly 
                        to seasonal time scales using the eddy covariance technique. I will use these data on benthic 
                        fluxes to quantify the integrated annual carbon sequestration of seagrass meadows. A 
                        chronosequence of restored meadows of different ages (time since seeding) located along 
                        Virginia coastal bays will be studied to better estimate how seagrass habitat restoration can 
                        enhance carbon sequestration.

                        My research will focus primarily on the ecology of oyster reefs in the shallow lagoons of the 
                        VCR-LTER. I will use the eddy covariance technique to measure oyster metabolism in response

                        My research focuses on the ecology of seagrass meadows in the shallow coastal bays 
                        of the VCR-LTER. I will be using the eddy covariance technique to quantify whole-system 
                        metabolism in a seagrass meadow during its recovery from a die-off event that occurred 
                        in summer 2015. I hope to quantify ecosystem metabolism response to changes in 
                        environmental and ecological variables, and compare my results to those obtained when the 
                        seagrass meadow was healthy. The die-off event in 2015 presents a unique opportunity to 
                        monitor the recovery of seagrass ecosystems, which has implications for future 
                        restoration efforts.

                        While the drivers of metabolism in aquatic ecosystems are well known and include nutrients, 
                        sunlight, temperature, organic matter inputs, and water flow or mixing, our ability to 
                        quantify the effects of these drivers on metabolism is limited. This limits our understanding 
                        of the impacts of these drivers on water quality and aquatic carbon transformation. My 
                        research focuses on a novel hydrodynamic technique, eddy covariance, which can be used to 
                        determine the flux of oxygen, heat, and salt in an aquatic ecosystem at a high temporal 
                        resolution and without a gas transfer velocity correction. The calculated fluxes which result 
                        can improve our predictions of an aquatic ecosystem’s response to environmental change.

                        An abundant source of nutrients to freshwater and shallow marine ecosystems is groundwater. 
                        Because over-enrichment of surface waters with nutrients leads to water quality degradation 
                        and habitat loss, I have also worked with seepage meters, radioisotopic tracers, thermal 
                        imagery, and salt and heat fluxes calculated with the eddy covariance technique to quantify 
                        sources of groundwater discharge to surface waters. The delivery of groundwater nutrients to 
                        surface water at some locations is controlled by microbial activity in sediments. By improving 
                        our understanding of these processes we can improve the application of our effort to preserving 
                        water quality and aquatic habitats.

                        My research focuses on coastal biogeochemistry and how natural and anthropogenic processes 
                        influence benthic carbon and nutrient cycling. These topics are important because human 
                        activities are rapidly altering these processes and the long-term effects of these changes are 
                        largely unknown. Because a large portion of the human population lives adjacent to the coast, 
                        we are tightly linked to the productivity and stability of coastal systems, and their ability to 
                        mitigate anthropogenic changes.

                        I use the eddy covariance technique to investigate the ambient, in-situ factors that control 
                        carbon cycling such as: nutrients, irradiance, benthic communities, waves, and currents. My PhD 
                        work is primarily on tropical coral reefs and seagrass meadows in south Florida. These results 
                        reveal the complex interactions of hydrodynamics with productivity, the tight link to irradiance, 
                        and complex benthic communities that efficiently harvest light to create linear photosynthesis to 
                        irradiance curves. These results also show the importance of sampling in-situ over large spatial 
                        scales as these effects are not able to be observed with any other methodology. Further, these 
                        measurements show extremely high production rates on coral reefs and why these areas are hotspots 
                        of biodiversity while being a large source of production for the surrounding areas.

                        I am interested in carbon dynamics in shallow coastal systems and how carbon cycling changes with 
                        a large scale ecosystem state change. My research focuses on using oxygen as a proxy for carbon 
                        metabolism at different stages of seagrass colonization in the shallow lagoons of the VCR-LTER. I 
                        use the eddy covariance technique to measure real time ecosystem metabolism throughout the year to 
                        observe seasonal variability in the ecosystem response to light, temperature, and flow.

                        My graduate thesis research focused on biogeochemical cycling and hydrodynamics of recovering seagrass 
                        meadows on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Specifically, Dr. Berg and I adapted the micrometeorological 
                        concept of eddy-covariance to measure fluctuations of dissolved oxygen in order to determine ecosystem 
                        metabolism dynamics of seagrasses. As a graduate research student for Dr. Berg, I was lucky to 
                        participate in multiple research cruises and field campaigns around the globe. After graduating from 
                        UVa, I accepted a research assistant position at the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, 
                        Scotland where I set up an aquatic eddy-covariance lab. Upon moving back to the United States, I 
                        decided to apply my educational background to marine policy and conservation.
